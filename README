Apache::Authen::Program is a mod_perl module that provides a
reasonably general mechanism to perform username/password
authentication in Apache by calling an external program.
Authentication by an external program is useful when a
program can perform an authentication not supported by any
Apache modules (for example, cross-domain authentication is
not supported by Apache::AuthenNTLM or Apache::AuthenSmb, but
is supported by Samba's smbclient program).

Installing Apache::Authen::Program follows the normal CPAN
convention:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
Remember that after installation, you will need to restart
your Apache server to load Apache::Authen::Program.

Please note that in this version of Apache::Authen::Program,
"make test" only ensures that the module loads without
errors.
